# Final Project (Milestone 2)
This represents my envisioned final work, illustrating the anticipated appearance. The piece consists of a total of 11 lights, and I intend to employ p5.js to create RGB colors that harmonize with my mask. The sequencing entails illuminating the outermost light initially, followed by four lights in the second cycle, and five in the third. Subsequently, all lights will flash in unison five additional times before resetting and initiating the cycle once again.

I plan to conduct user testing for my headdress accessory after completing this phase. Given the potential presence of a breadboard inside the hat, making it unwearable, I may position it on a table for observers. My project aligns with our readings by providing individuals with an immersive experience of futuristic technology. Simultaneously, it seeks to integrate technology seamlessly into our daily lives. I believe that coding, as articulated in our readings, has consistently found practical applications in our everyday existence.
